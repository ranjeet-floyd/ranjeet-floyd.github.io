Recently i had read book Head First Design principle. I am outlining the summary for Object Oriented(OO) Design Principles. Below the the basic OO design principle points:

  1. Encapsulate what varies.
  2. Favor Composition over Inheritance.
  3. Program to interface, not implementations.
  4. Strive for loosely coupled desigins between objects that interact.
  5. Classes should be open for extension but closed for modification.
  6. Depend on abstractions. Do not depend on concretions.
  7. Only talk to your friends.
